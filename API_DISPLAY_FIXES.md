# API Configuration and Display Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. API Configuration Problems ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: API keys were hardcoded as empty strings in `build.gradle.kts`, not reading from `local.properties`.

**Solution**:
- Modified `app/build.gradle.kts` to properly read `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` from `local.properties`
- Added fallback to empty strings if keys are not found
- Added proper import for `Properties` class

**Files Changed**:
- `app/build.gradle.kts`

### 2. API Key Error Handling ✅ IMPROVED

**Problem**: Some screens didn't provide clear feedback when API keys were missing.

**Solution**:
- Added `AiKeyGate` component to `PlanScreen` for proper API key validation
- Removed redundant API status checks from onClick handlers  
- Updated button enabled state to consider API availability
- Existing `NutritionScreen` already used `AiKeyGate` properly

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/fitapp/ui/screens/PlanScreen.kt`

### 3. Display/Resolution Issues ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: UI components had responsive design issues that could cause display problems on different screen resolutions.

**Solutions**:

#### Weekday Selection (PlanScreen)
- Replaced fixed row layout with adaptive chunking layout
- Reduced font sizes for better mobile compatibility
- Added minimum touch target heights (32dp)
- Improved spacing and layout distribution

#### Navigation Drawer (MainScaffold)
- Added proper scrolling support to handle many navigation items
- Wrapped drawer content in scrollable Column
- Added proper imports for scroll functionality

**Files Changed**:
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/fitapp/ui/screens/PlanScreen.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/example/fitapp/ui/MainScaffold.kt`

## Configuration Instructions

### Setting up API Keys

1. Copy `local.properties.sample` to `local.properties`
2. Add your API keys:
   ```properties
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_key_here
   ```
3. The app will now automatically read these keys during build

### Getting API Keys

**Gemini API Key**:
- Visit [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com)
- Create account and generate API key

**Perplexity API Key**:
- Visit [perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)
- Go to Settings → API and create key

## Error Handling Improvements

### AiKeyGate Component
- Automatically detects missing API keys
- Shows clear warning messages to users
- Provides direct navigation to API key configuration
- Prevents API calls when keys are missing

### Screen-Level Handling
- `PlanScreen`: Now uses AiKeyGate for proper validation
- `NutritionScreen`: Already had proper AiKeyGate implementation
- `FoodScanScreen`: Has error handling that shows appropriate messages for API failures

## Responsive Design Improvements

### Mobile Compatibility
- Reduced touch target sizes where appropriate
- Improved text scaling for smaller screens
- Added proper scrolling to prevent content overflow

### Layout Adaptivity
- Weekday selection now adapts to available space
- Navigation drawer scrolls to accommodate all items
- Better spacing and alignment across components

## Testing Results

✅ Build succeeds with both empty and configured API keys  
✅ No lint errors  
✅ Responsive layout improvements functional  
✅ Error handling provides clear user feedback  

## Files Modified

1. `app/build.gradle.kts` - API key configuration
2. `app/src/main/java/com/example/fitapp/ui/screens/PlanScreen.kt` - AiKeyGate + responsive design
3. `app/src/main/java/com/example/fitapp/ui/MainScaffold.kt` - Drawer scrolling

## Next Steps

The core issues have been resolved. The app now:
- Properly reads API keys from local.properties
- Provides clear feedback when API keys are missing
- Has improved responsive design for better display across resolutions
- Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

For production deployment, consider implementing encrypted storage for API keys rather than plain text in local.properties.
