# Navigation Fixes and Improvements - Summary

## Overview
This PR addresses issues #270 and #274 regarding missing and inaccessible features in the FitApp navigation system.

## Problem Statement
The following features were reported as missing or inaccessible:
- Recipe Generation - Screen existed but entry points were missing
- AI Assistant/Personal Trainer - Buttons had empty onClick handlers
- HIIT Training - Navigation paths were unclear
- Quick Actions - No centralized quick actions feature
- Feedback - No feedback mechanism for users

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Missing Screens
- **FeedbackScreen.kt** - Complete feedback form with multiple feedback types
- **QuickActionsScreen.kt** - Central hub for all commonly used actions

### 2. Fixed Navigation Routes
- Added `feedback` route with deep link support (`fitapp://feedback`)
- Added `quick_actions` route with deep link support (`fitapp://quick_actions`)
- Enhanced existing routes with deep link support:
  - `recipe_generation` → `fitapp://recipe_generation`
  - `ai_personal_trainer` → `fitapp://ai_personal_trainer`
  - `hiit_builder` → `fitapp://hiit_builder`

### 3. Fixed Broken Functionality
- **AI Personal Trainer**: 
  - Added navigation callbacks for workout, nutrition, and progress features
  - Fixed empty onClick handlers in QuickActionsCard
  - Connected "Workout starten" and "Plan anzeigen" buttons to actual navigation
  - Quick action buttons now navigate to:
    - Generate Workout → Today Training
    - Nutrition Advice → Nutrition Hub
    - Analyze Progress → Enhanced Analytics

### 4. Enhanced Navigation Access
- **Drawer Navigation**: Added "⚡ Schnellaktionen" entry
- **Overflow Menu**: Added "Feedback senden" option
- **TopAppBar**: Added quick actions button in default view
- **Context Actions**: Maintained existing context-sensitive quick actions
