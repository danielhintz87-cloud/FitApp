# Accessibility Setup Test and Validation

This file demonstrates and validates the accessibility setup implemented for FitApp.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Lint Configuration (`app/lint.xml`)
- Enables accessibility-specific Android Lint rules
- Sets severity levels (error for critical issues, warning for others)
- Covers: ContentDescription, TouchTargetSize, ClickableViewAccessibility, etc.

### 2. Build Configuration (`app/build.gradle.kts`)
- Added Compose UI lint checks dependency for Compose-specific accessibility validation
- Configured lint baseline to prevent existing issues from blocking CI while catching new violations
- Set `abortOnError = true` to ensure CI fails on new accessibility violations

### 3. Detekt Configuration (`detekt.yml`)
- Enhanced with additional rules to support accessibility best practices
- Added coroutines and comments sections for better code quality

### 4. Documentation (`docs/accessibility-checklist.md`)
- Comprehensive manual testing checklist for TalkBack and VoiceOver
- Covers navigation, content labeling, forms, media, and color contrast
- Includes testing scenarios and common issues to watch for

### 5. PR Template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Added dedicated accessibility review section
- Includes checkboxes for automated and manual testing
- References accessibility checklist documentation

### 6. Test File (`app/src/main/java/com/example/fitapp/accessibility/AccessibilityTestScreen.kt`)
- Demonstrates both accessible and inaccessible Compose code
- Will trigger lint errors for violations once project compiles
- Shows proper accessibility implementation patterns

## Validation

### Static Analysis Tools Working
✅ **Detekt**: Successfully runs and generates reports
```bash
./gradlew detekt
# Generates HTML, XML, SARIF, and text reports
```

✅ **Ktlint**: Identifies formatting issues (some require manual fixes)
```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```

### Lint Setup Ready
✅ **Lint Configuration**: Created with accessibility rules
✅ **Baseline**: Configured to handle existing issues
✅ **CI Integration**: Existing ci-lint.yml workflow will use new configuration

## When Project Compiles Successfully

1. **Generate Proper Baseline**:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew updateLintBaseline
   ```

2. **Test Accessibility Violations**:
   - The `AccessibilityTestScreen.kt` contains intentional violations
   - These should trigger lint errors once baseline is generated

3. **Verify CI Workflow**:
   - Push changes to trigger ci-lint.yml workflow
   - Should pass with baseline but fail on new violations

## Expected Behavior

### New Accessibility Violations Will Fail CI:
- Missing content descriptions on interactive elements
- Touch targets smaller than 48dp
- Clickable elements without proper accessibility support
- Missing state descriptions for dynamic content

### Documentation Guides Manual Testing:
- TalkBack navigation testing procedures
- Color contrast verification
- Form accessibility validation
- Media content accessibility

### PR Process Enhanced:
- All PRs now include accessibility review section
- Developers must confirm accessibility testing completed
- Links to comprehensive testing checklist

## Next Steps

Once compilation issues are resolved:
1. Run `./gradlew updateLintBaseline` to generate proper baseline
2. Test with intentional accessibility violations
3. Verify CI pipeline catches new violations
4. Train team on using accessibility checklist

This setup provides both automated guardrails and manual testing guidance to ensure accessibility is maintained throughout development.
