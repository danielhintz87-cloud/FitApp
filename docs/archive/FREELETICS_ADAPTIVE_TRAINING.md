## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### `FreeleticsStyleAdaptiveTrainer`
The main adaptive training engine that provides:
```kotlin
class FreeleticsStyleAdaptiveTrainer(context: Context) {
    // Real-time workout adaptation
    suspend fun adaptWorkoutRealTime(
        currentExercise: ExerciseStep,
        currentPerformance: RealTimePerformance,
        sessionContext: WorkoutSessionContext
    ): WorkoutAdaptation
    
    // Dynamic difficulty adjustment
    suspend fun adjustDifficultyRealTime(
        currentExercise: ExerciseStep,
        performanceIndicators: PerformanceIndicators
    ): DifficultyAdjustment
    
    // Exercise substitution
    suspend fun suggestExerciseSubstitution(
        currentExercise: ExerciseStep,
        performanceIssues: List<PerformanceIssue>,
        availableEquipment: List<String>
    ): ExerciseSubstitution?
    
    // Adaptive rest calculation
    suspend fun calculateAdaptiveRestTime(
        lastSetPerformance: SetPerformance,
        currentFatigueLevel: Float,
        targetIntensity: Float,
        exerciseType: String
    ): AdaptiveRestCalculation
}
```

#### Adaptive UI Components
- **`FreeleticsAdaptiveTrainingPanel`** - Main control panel showing real-time adaptations
- **`AdaptiveCoachingFeedbackCard`** - AI coaching messages with actionable suggestions
- **`RealTimePerformanceInsights`** - Session progress and adaptation history
- **Workout adaptation alerts** - User-friendly prompts for exercise modifications

### Data Models

#### Real-Time Performance Tracking
```kotlin
data class RealTimePerformance(
    val formQuality: Float,      // 0.0-1.0 form quality score
    val rpe: Int,                // 1-10 Rate of Perceived Exertion
    val heartRate: Int?,         // Current heart rate (BPM)
    val currentRep: Int,         // Current repetition number
    val movementSpeed: Float,    // Relative to optimal speed
    val timestamp: Long
)
```

#### Workout Adaptations
```kotlin
data class WorkoutAdaptation(
    val type: AdaptationType,                    // Type of adaptation
    val modifications: List<AdaptiveExerciseModification>,
    val reasoning: String,                       // Human-readable explanation
    val confidence: Float                        // AI confidence level
)

enum class AdaptationType {
    NO_CHANGE, INCREASE_INTENSITY, REDUCE_INTENSITY,
    MODIFY_TECHNIQUE, SUBSTITUTE_EXERCISE, 
    ADJUST_REST_TIME, CHANGE_TEMPO
}
```

## üéØ Freeletics Model Implementation

### Real-Time Adaptation Philosophy
Unlike traditional fitness apps that only adjust between sessions, our implementation:

1. **Monitors performance continuously** during workout execution
2. **Makes adaptive decisions every 2 seconds** based on current state
3. **Applies changes immediately** without waiting for session completion
4. **Learns from each exercise** to optimize the remaining workout

### Adaptation Triggers

#### Performance-Based Triggers
- **Form degradation** (< 60% quality) ‚Üí Reduce intensity, improve technique focus
- **Excellent form** (> 90% quality) ‚Üí Increase difficulty, add challenge
- **High fatigue** (RPE > 8) ‚Üí Extended rest, reduced weight/reps
- **Low effort** (RPE < 6) ‚Üí Increase intensity, add volume

#### Physiological Triggers
- **Heart rate zones** ‚Üí Automatic intensity adjustments
- **Movement asymmetries** ‚Üí Exercise substitution recommendations
- **Consistency loss** ‚Üí Technique modification suggestions

### Smart Decision Making

#### Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm
```kotlin
val adjustmentFactor = when {
    formQuality > 0.9f && fatigueLevel < 0.4f -> 1.15f  // Increase 15%
    formQuality < 0.5f -> 0.85f                         // Reduce 15%
    fatigueLevel > 0.8f -> 0.75f                        // Reduce 25%
    else -> 1.0f                                        // No change
}
```

#### Exercise Substitution Logic
- **Form issues** ‚Üí Suggest simpler variations with technique focus
- **Equipment limitations** ‚Üí Alternative exercises with available equipment
- **Fatigue concerns** ‚Üí Less demanding movements targeting different muscle groups
- **Injury risk** ‚Üí Safer alternatives with reduced load

## üé® User Experience

### Adaptive Training Panel
The main UI shows:
- **Real-time performance metrics** (Form %, RPE, Heart Rate, Rep count)
- **Active adaptations** with clear reasoning
- **Suggested modifications** with accept/decline options
- **Coaching feedback** with actionable recommendations

### User Control
- **Toggle adaptive training** on/off during workout
- **Accept or decline** each suggested adaptation
- **View adaptation history** for the current session
- **Custom override** options for AI suggestions

### Feedback Messages
Examples of adaptive coaching feedback:
- **"Perfekte Ausf√ºhrung! üí™ Bereit f√ºr Intensit√§tssteigerung"**
- **"Fokus auf saubere Technik! üéØ Gewicht reduzieren empfohlen"**
- **"Hohe Belastung - achte auf deine Grenzen ‚ö†Ô∏è"**

## üîß Integration

### Enhanced Training Execution Screen
The adaptive features are seamlessly integrated into the existing training interface:

```kotlin
// Real-time adaptation monitoring
LaunchedEffect(isInTraining, currentExerciseIndex, advancedState.formQuality) {
    if (isInTraining && advancedState.isAdaptiveTrainingEnabled) {
        // Create performance snapshot
        val realTimePerformance = RealTimePerformance(...)
        
        // Get adaptation recommendations
        val adaptation = adaptiveTrainer.adaptWorkoutRealTime(...)
        
        // Update UI state
        if (adaptation.type != AdaptationType.NO_CHANGE) {
            advancedState = advancedState.copy(currentWorkoutAdaptation = adaptation)
        }
    }
}
```

### State Management
Adaptive training state is managed through:
```kotlin
data class AdvancedTrainingUiState(
    // ... existing state ...
    
    // Freeletics-style Adaptive Training State
    val currentWorkoutAdaptation: WorkoutAdaptation? = null,
    val adaptiveCoachingFeedback: AdaptiveCoachingFeedback? = null,
    val realTimePerformance: RealTimePerformance? = null,
    val difficultyAdjustment: DifficultyAdjustment? = null,
    val exerciseSubstitution: ExerciseSubstitution? = null,
    val adaptiveRestCalculation: AdaptiveRestCalculation? = null,
    val isAdaptiveTrainingEnabled: Boolean = true,
    val adaptationHistory: List<WorkoutAdaptation> = emptyList()
)
```
