# FitApp Implementation Summary

## Issues Addressed Successfully

### ✅ 1. Weight Tracking Streak Logic Implementation
**Problem**: Weight tracking streaks contained only placeholder logic
**Solution**: 
- Created complete `WeightEntity` with database table structure
- Added database migration from version 7 to 8
- Implemented `WeightDao` with full CRUD operations
- Added weight tracking methods to `NutritionRepository`
- Fixed `PersonalStreakManager.updateWeightTrackingStreak()` method
- Created comprehensive `WeightTrackingScreen` with:
  - Weight entry form with validation
  - Weight history display
  - Delete functionality
  - Automatic streak tracking
  - Motivational background image integration

### ✅ 2. Training Completion/Skip TODO Placeholders
**Problem**: Multiple UI screens had TODO placeholders for training actions
**Solutions**:

#### TodayScreen.kt
- Implemented "Training abgeschlossen" button functionality
- Implemented "Training überspringen" button functionality  
- Both actions properly update workout status in database
- Completed training triggers streak tracking

#### TodayTrainingScreen.kt
- Fixed "Training abgeschlossen" button to save workout and trigger streaks
- Implemented custom training creation and automatic saving
- Added proper error handling and user feedback

#### MainScaffold.kt
- Fixed TrainingExecutionScreen completion callback
- Added workout status tracking and streak management
- Proper context handling and repository integration

### ✅ 3. Motivational Image Integration
**Problem**: 22 generated images in drawable folder were unused
**Solution**:
- Integrated `generated_image.png` into TodayScreen's DailyMotivationCard
- Added `generated_image_5.png` to ProgressScreen's AchievementShowcase
- Used `generated_image_10.png` in new WeightTrackingScreen
- Images used as background with 20-30% opacity for subtle enhancement
- Proper ContentScale.Crop for consistent display

### ✅ 4. OpenJDK-17 Configuration
**Problem**: Local environment ca-certificates-java configuration issue
**Finding**: No actual code-level configuration issues found
**Result**: Build system works correctly with OpenJDK-17

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- New weight_entries table (migration 7->8)
CREATE TABLE weight_entries (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    weight REAL NOT NULL,
    dateIso TEXT NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    recordedAt INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```
