## 🏗️ CI/CD Architecture

### Pipeline Workflows
1. **`android-room-ci.yml`** (Enhanced) - Core CI with build, test, schema validation
2. **`android_tests.yml`** (Existing) - Comprehensive test suite
3. **`code-quality.yml`** (New) - Quality, security, and performance analysis
4. **`release.yml`** (New) - Automated release builds and deployment
5. **`update-badges.yml`** (New) - Dynamic documentation updates

### Quality Gates
- ✅ All unit tests must pass
- ✅ Code must compile without errors
- ✅ Lint analysis (no critical issues)
