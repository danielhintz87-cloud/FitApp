# Nutrition-Training Coupling Implementation Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This implementation enhances the FitApp with sophisticated nutrition-training coupling features, creating a seamless integration between workout routines and nutritional guidance. The system provides personalized recommendations based on training type, intensity, and timing.

## ðŸš€ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced NutritionManager Service

#### Workout-Aware Nutrition Recommendations
- **generateWorkoutNutritionRecommendations()**: Core method that generates comprehensive nutrition advice based on:
  - Workout type (Strength, Cardio, HIIT, Mixed)
  - Workout intensity (Low, Moderate, High)
  - Workout duration
  - Time until workout

#### Pre-Workout Nutrition
- **Timing-based recommendations**: Different advice based on time until workout
  - < 30 minutes: Quick carbs (banana, dates)
  - 30-90 minutes: Balanced meal with carbs + protein
  - > 90 minutes: Complete meal 2-3 hours before
- **Workout-specific guidance**: 
  - Strength training: Emphasis on protein and energy
  - Cardio: Focus on easily digestible carbs
  - HIIT: Balanced but light to avoid discomfort

#### Post-Workout Nutrition
- **Recovery-focused recommendations**: Protein and carb ratios based on:
  - Strength training: Higher protein (25-30g) for muscle recovery
  - Cardio: Moderate protein (15-20g) for general recovery
  - Workout intensity determines carb needs (20-50g)
- **Timing guidance**: Recommendations for optimal nutrient timing window

#### Hydration Calculations
- **Dynamic fluid needs**: Based on workout duration and intensity
- **Environment considerations**: Temperature adjustments
- **Electrolyte recommendations**: For longer or intense workouts

### 2. Enhanced NutritionRepository

#### Dynamic Calorie Adjustments
- **adjustCaloriesForCompletedWorkout()**: Automatically adjusts daily calorie goals based on:
  - Estimated calories burned during workout
  - Adds 50% of burned calories to daily goal for proper fueling
  - Considers workout type and intensity for accurate estimates

#### AI-Enhanced Recommendations
- **generatePreWorkoutNutrition()**: Context-aware pre-workout meal suggestions
- **generatePostWorkoutNutrition()**: Recovery-focused post-workout nutrition

### Data Classes and Models

```kotlin
// Workout-specific nutrition recommendation
data class WorkoutNutritionRecommendation(
    val preWorkoutMeal: MealRecommendation,
    val postWorkoutMeal: MealRecommendation,
    val hydrationNeeds: HydrationRecommendation,
    val macroAdjustments: WorkoutMacroAdjustments,
    val workoutType: WorkoutType,
    val estimatedCaloriesBurned: Int
)

// Pre/post workout meal guidance
data class MealRecommendation(
    val foods: List<String>,
    val calories: Int,
    val timing: String,
    val reasoning: String
)

// Hydration planning
data class HydrationRecommendation(
    val totalFluidNeeds: Int, // ml
    val timing: String,
    val type: String
)

// Workout-specific macro adjustments
data class WorkoutMacroAdjustments(
    val additionalProtein: Int, // grams
    val additionalCarbs: Int, // grams
    val additionalCalories: Int
)
```

### Workout Types and Intensities

```kotlin
enum class WorkoutType {
    STRENGTH,    // Focus on protein and energy
    CARDIO,      // Focus on carbs and hydration
    HIIT,        // Balanced but quick-digesting
    MIXED        // General recommendations
}

enum class WorkoutIntensity {
    LOW,         // 0.7x multiplier
    MODERATE,    // 1.0x multiplier
    HIGH         // 1.3x multiplier
}
```

### Calorie Estimation Algorithm

```kotlin
// Base rates (calories per minute)
- Strength training: 6 cal/min
- Cardio: 10 cal/min
- HIIT: 12 cal/min
- Mixed/Functional: 7-8 cal/min

// Intensity adjustments
- Low: 0.7x multiplier
- Moderate: 1.0x multiplier
- High: 1.3x multiplier
```
