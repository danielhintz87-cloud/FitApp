Welcome to Gradle 8.14.3!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Java 24 support
 - GraalVM Native Image toolchain selection
 - Enhancements to test reporting
 - Build Authoring improvements

For more details see https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/release-notes.html

To honour the JVM settings for this build a single-use Daemon process will be forked. For more on this, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/gradle_daemon.html#sec:disabling_the_daemon in the Gradle documentation.
Daemon will be stopped at the end of the build

[Incubating] Problems report is available at: file:///home/runner/work/FitApp/FitApp/build/reports/problems/problems-report.html

FAILURE: Build completed with 3 failures.

1: Task failed with an exception.
-----------
* What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':app:processDebugResources' (type 'LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask').
  - Type 'com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.LinkApplicationAndroidResourcesTask' property 'localResourcesFile' specifies file '/home/runner/work/FitApp/FitApp/app/build/intermediates/local_only_symbol_list/debug/parseDebugLocalResources/R-def.txt' which doesn't exist.
    
    Reason: An input file was expected to be present but it doesn't exist.
    
    Possible solutions:
      1. Make sure the file exists before the task is called.
      2. Make sure that the task which produces the file is declared as an input.
    
    For more information, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/validation_problems.html#input_file_does_not_exist in the Gradle documentation.

* Try:
> Make sure the file exists before the task is called
> Make sure that the task which produces the file is declared as an input

2: Task failed with an exception.
-----------
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:stripDebugDebugSymbols'.
> A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.StripDebugSymbolsDelegate
   > There were multiple failures while executing work items
      > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.StripDebugSymbolsRunnable
         > /home/runner/work/FitApp/FitApp/app/build/intermediates/merged_native_libs/debug/mergeDebugNativeLibs/out/lib/arm64-v8a/libandroidx.graphics.path.so

3: Task failed with an exception.
-----------
* What went wrong:
A problem was found with the configuration of task ':app:mergeExtDexDebug' (type 'DexMergingTask').
  - Type 'com.android.build.gradle.internal.tasks.DexMergingTask' property 'fileDependencyDexDir' specifies directory '/home/runner/work/FitApp/FitApp/app/build/intermediates/external_file_lib_dex_archives/debug/desugarDebugFileDependencies' which doesn't exist.
    
    Reason: An input file was expected to be present but it doesn't exist.
    
    Possible solutions:
      1. Make sure the directory exists before the task is called.
      2. Make sure that the task which produces the directory is declared as an input.
    
    For more information, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/8.14.3/userguide/validation_problems.html#input_file_does_not_exist in the Gradle documentation.

* Try:
